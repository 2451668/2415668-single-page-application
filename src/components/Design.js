        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>Below are the wireframes that outlined the basic look, structure, and layout of the site. They served as my blueprint for the design, helping to ensure a consistent user experience across all the pages featured.</p>

        <h2>Style Guide</h2>
        <p>The style guide defines the visual elements used throughout the website, including colors, typography, and other design components. This guide helps maintain a cohesive and visually appealing design.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Colors:</strong> I used shades of green (#2e7d32, #66bb6a), brown (#8d6e63), and light grey (#f0f0f0) to reflect the natural theme.</li>
          <li><strong>Typography:</strong> The primary font is 'Poppins', chosen for its readability and modern look. A personal favourite of mine.</li>
          <li><strong>Buttons:</strong> Buttons have a flat design with subtle animations to enhance user interaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rationale and Reflection</h2>
        <p>I focused on creating something user-friendly and visually appealing; an experience that celebrates tree life in South Africa. To this end, I used green and brown tones to reflect the natural theme, while the choice of typography ensures readability. The site guides users from one section to another, with intuitive navigation via the (sticky) navbar and matching animations and transitions for a pleasant look and feel all-round.</p>
        <p>I made wood grain patterns that are used in the background, navbar, and footer to enhance the nature theme and provide a consistent visual texture across the site. A somewhat artistic representation and a subtle nod to the look of tree bark  out there in real world</p>
        <p>Additionally, I added a subtle jiggle animation to the "Trees!" brand in the navbar. This animation adds a playful element to the design, drawing attention to the brand and making the navigation experience more engaging; an easter egg of sorts, if you will.</p>
        <p>Previous iterations featured a sort of inverse look to what there is now, using primarily dark browns for the body and fill, and conversely lighter colours for the text and accents, though a few of my peers told me a combination of beiges and tan tones and dark accents looked better.</p>
