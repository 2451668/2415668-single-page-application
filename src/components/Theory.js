      <h3>The main theory content for this semester was the exploration of Net Art and developing an understanding of how it is made, and how we can use what we learned in developing our own bit of net art. Below is my submission for our second semester assignment - the net art essay.</h3>
      <br></br>
      <h2>Net Art</h2>
      <br></br>
      <h3>Much of our theoretical coursework this semester focused on understanding net or web 
      art‚Äîits definition, origins, distinctions from traditional art, and significance as a 
      worthwhile form of creative expression. Moving on from the theoretical to the practical 
      with a case study, I would like to speak about what I understand about net art and will be 
      basing my framework for this essay on a handful of the assigned readings, supplemented 
      by a handful of some I sourced online.</h3>
      <br></br>
      <h3>Emerging prominently in the early 1990s, net art utilizes the internet both as a medium 
      and as a platform for creating, showcasing, and distributing art. Unlike traditional art, 
      which often relies on tangible materials and physical spaces, net art exists in the digital 
      realm, accessible via any internet-connected device (Paul, 2003). This shift not only 
      dismantles physical barriers but also facilitates global engagement and interactivity 
      (Carrier, 2018). This is unlike scans, photographs, or recordings, which are themselves 
      representations of another creative work, due to not being able to experience the work 
      personally (Rush, 2005). </h3>
      <br></br>
      <h3>Before really getting into the theory behind net art, I had lumped in all digital art as 
      technically being ‚Äòart on the net‚Äô; digital artworks, such as portraits created in Procreate 
      or models in Blender, represent digital adaptations of traditional art practices (like 
      painting and sculpting); they are not net art. The Procreate portrait is a callback to 
      traditional portraiture, with the reposted image we would see online not being the.png 
      the artist saved on his iPad, which is itself a conversion and export of Procreate's native 
      file format. These don‚Äôt feature the interactive and network-based aspects that make net 
      art (Greene, 2004). </h3>
      <br></br>
      <h3>et art as a genre distinctly leverages the internet, not just as a hosting platform but as an 
      essential component of artistic expression, uniquely engaging the audience and offering 
      interactive experiences where viewers can even influence or change the artwork itself. 
      This interactivity transforms viewers from passive recipients to active participants, 
      resulting in a shift in the relationship between the artwork and audience (Hertzmann, 
      2018). Speaking to the temporal and spatial, unlike traditional art, which exists within defined spatial and temporal boundaries, net art can be ephemeral and continuously 
      evolving (Manovich, 2001). It transcends geographic and temporal limitations and allows 
      for real-time interactions and updates, which is not a feature of any other conventional 
      art practice (Carrier, 2018). This property serves as my primary motivation for my chosen 
      case study for this writing.</h3>
      <br></br>
      <h3>"Death Imitates Language" by Harm van den Dorpel is, I believe, a great exemplar of net 
      art, leveraging code to explore themes of genetic inheritance and mutation through a 
      unique interactive and generative process. His artwork employs algorithms similar to 
      those used in genetic selection to create visual art, underscoring the evolving nature of 
      digital artworks and their capacity for real-time interaction and transformation. </h3>
      <br></br>
      <h3>It was launched in 2016 and uses a generative algorithm to create new artwork from a set 
      of existing images, referred to as 'parents.' These parent images, initially created by van 
      den Dorpel himself, undergo a digital'recombination' process where the algorithm selects 
      and merges elements of the parent images to produce new child artworks. This process 
      mimics biological inheritance but in a digital context, highlighting the intersection of 
      biology, technology, and art. Additionally, it features some integration of blockchain 
      technology. Each artwork generated is recorded on a blockchain, which serves not only 
      to authenticate the piece as a unique work of art but also to track its ownership history. 
      This use of blockchain, I believe, underscores a critical aspect of net art‚Äîits engagement 
      with digital culture's contemporary issues, such as digital rights, ownership, and the 
      reproducibility of digital objects. The project is inherently interactive, inviting viewers to 
      engage with the artwork not just as observers but as participants. Owners of the parent 
      artworks have the opportunity to allow their pieces to be used in the creation of new 
      generations, directly influencing the evolution of the artwork series. This sort of 
      interaction, where the audience impacts the artwork's development, exemplifies the shift 
      in art consumption from passive observation to active participation, which, as mentioned 
      before, is a crucial feature of net art (Carrier, 2018; Hertzmann, 2018).  </h3>
      <br></br>
      <h3>he evolving nature of the piece is a pivotal characteristic. Unlike traditional art, which 
      remains static once completed, this artwork is designed to evolve continually. The digital 
      realm facilitates this dynamic evolution, allowing the artwork to change and grow over 
      time, reflecting the mutable and transient nature of digital media. I interpreted this as 
      speaking to the broader themes of net art's capacity to mirror the fluidity and rapid changes inherent in the digital world. I will not spend any time discussing the philosophy 
      behind what art or an artist's creation is. In general, as those are beyond the scope of this 
      writing, I will acknowledge that, at least conceptually, van den Dorpel's work probes 
      some deep philosophical questions about the nature of creation, the role of the artist, and 
      the impact of technology on traditional practices. It certainly challenges viewers to 
      reconsider the meaning of originality and creativity in an age dominated by digital 
      technology and artificial intelligence.  </h3>
      <br></br>
      <h3>That was some exposition and context behind the piece, and in this section, I would like 
      to analyse the work specifically in the framework of net art as we covered it in our 
      theoretical content and a bit more generally in the context of net art more broadly.  </h3>
      <br></br>
      <h3>As stated before, one of the defining features of Death Imitates Language is its 
      interactive nature, which aligns with Aaron Hertzmann‚Äôs discussion on the evolving role 
      of the viewer in digital art. Hertzmann highlights that contemporary digital technologies 
      not only alter the way art is produced but also how it is perceived and engaged with by 
      audiences (Hertzmann, 2018). In van den Dorpel's project, the audience is not merely 
      observing but actively participating in the creation of new artworks. This engagement is 
      facilitated by the digital platform, which allows viewers to influence the generative 
      process by deciding whether their owned 'parent' artworks can be used to produce new 
      'child' artworks. This mechanism shows a significant shift in the role of the audience 
      from passive recipients to active contributors, which is a central theme in net art and a 
      major departure from traditional artistic practices. The use of generative algorithms in 
      Death Imitates Language offers a good parallel to biological processes, which David 
      Carrier discusses in terms of digital reproduction's impact on art‚Äôs authenticity and 
      uniqueness (Carrier, 2018). Van den Dorpel's approach‚Äîusing algorithms that mimic 
      genetic selection‚Äîchallenges traditional notions of creativity and authorship. The 
      artworks generated are unique not only in their aesthetic but also in their conceptual 
      inception, reflecting the digital age's influence on our understanding of creation and 
      originality. This process questions the boundaries of artistic creation, suggesting a new 
      paradigm where the 'artist' is a curator of processes rather than a sole creator of objects. I 
      won‚Äôt speak on the relevance of blockchain in the role of net art, as that is more of a  
      feature of this work in particular, but I will say that, in some form, it does engage with 
      today‚Äôs culture and broader discussions about copyright, ownership, or simply the ‚Äúreproducibility of digital objects‚Äù (Carrier, 2018). Blockchain is one solution to the 
      problem with digital art‚Äîits ease of duplication and the consequent challenges to 
      establishing and maintaining value, even if the advents of cryptocurrencies and NFTs 
      have left a poor impression on the general public. </h3>
      <br></br>
      <h3>To take it in a different direction, I would like to spend a passage talking about my own 
      interpretation of two specific pieces of the collection, or the population as Dorpel has 
      labelled them on the site. </h3>
      <br></br>
      <h3>Above are Eve and Adam, respectively, and I chose these two in particular to talk about 
      because of the genealogy feature that Dorpel has, which allows one to track the parents 
      of any given artwork. Interestingly, you are not able to do so with the two above. Adam 
      and Eve have children, but no parents you can navigate to. I found it extremely 
      interesting that Eve was completely blank, and Adam was visually the most complex of 
      all the generations featured in the site. Adam lacks much in the way of colour; the 
      children's artworks all seem to share this; however, the detail in the Adam piece is not 
      replicated in any of the child objects and is the first to feature the dotted overlay pattern 
      that is recurring in much of the population. Eve, by contrast, is the only object that has 
      one solid fill and has the least amount of detail in any of the featured artworks. Given the 
      juxtaposition, I suppose Eve might stand as a canvas of sorts, or an ode to the potential 
      for creation (Paul, 2003). In contrast, Adam could represent or encapsulate the interent‚Äôs 
      evolved state, featuring many layers of complexity and an aggregation of data, visuals, 
      and code reflecting contemporary digital life (Manovich, 2001). </h3>
      <br></br>
      <h3>Death Imitates Language, at least at the time it was released, could be seen as setting the 
      stage for a broader showcase of generative art, where the creative process is defined not 
      by the artist‚Äôs hand but by an algorithm's capacity to select, combine, and recontextualise. 
      The offspring emerging from the two progenitors are a testament to the algorithm‚Äôs role 
      as, if not an artist itself, then a mediator between ideas and having these ideas realised. It 
      embodies the transformative nature of net art, constantly evolving and reshaping itself in 
      response to digital stimuli (Rush, 2005).  </h3>
